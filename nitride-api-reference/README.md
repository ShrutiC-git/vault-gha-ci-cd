# Nitride API Reference

This is the API documentation for the remote attestation auth engine. For general information about the usage and operation of the auth engine, please see the Vault documentation.

{% hint style="info" %}
This documentation assumes the auth engine engine is enabled at the `/raTLS` path. Since it is possible to enable auth engines at any location, please update your API calls accordingly.
